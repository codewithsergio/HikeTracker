# Hike Tracker

You can visit this project by clicking this link: https://my-hikes-d702e.web.app/

Created to gamify exploring new places, upon visiting one of the pre-chosen locations, users can verify that they have arrived and check that location off for a point. A leaderboard is used to compare scores across users. To gain the point, we geographically verify the user's position by requesting permission for their location.

You can login with your gmail account to save your locations across devices.
